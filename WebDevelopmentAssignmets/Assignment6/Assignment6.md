1. Whatâ€™s Constructor And Its Purpose?
* **Answer**
*  Constructors are functions used as blueprints for creating objects of a particular type or class. When a constructor function is invoked with the new keyword, it creates and initializes a new instance of the object.
* The purpose of constructors in JS are:
    * Object initialization: Constructors are used to initialize the state of an object by assigning values to its properties or setting up initial configurations. They define the initial state of the object when it is created, ensuring that it is ready to be used.

    * Encapsulation: Constructors encapsulate the behavior and properties of an object within a single entity. They group related data and functionality together, making it easier to manage and interact with objects.

    * Prototype linkage: Constructors in JavaScript are associated with a prototype object. This prototype object contains methods and properties shared by all instances created using the constructor. It allows for efficient memory usage as methods and properties are shared among instances rather than duplicated for each object.

    * Inheritance: Constructors and prototypes enable inheritance in JavaScript. By defining constructors and their prototypes, you can create hierarchies of objects where child objects inherit properties and methods from parent objects. This promotes code reusability and helps create more organized and structured code.

    * Customization and extensibility: Constructors allow developers to create objects with customizable properties and behaviors. By accepting parameters, constructors can be used to initialize objects with specific values, allowing flexibility in object creation.

2. Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?

* **Answer**
The this keyword in JavaScript is a special identifier that refers to the current execution context. Its purpose is to provide a reference to the object that is currently executing or being acted upon within a function or method.

The behavior of this depends on how and where it is used:

* Global context: In the global scope (outside of any function), this refers to the global object. In most JavaScript environments, the global object is window in a browser or global in Node.js.

* Function context: In a regular function (not an arrow function), the value of this is determined dynamically at runtime. It depends on how the function is invoked. The this value is set to the object on which the function is called or the object that is used as the context when calling the function.

* Method context: When a function is defined as a method of an object, this refers to the object itself. It allows the method to access and manipulate the object's properties and methods.

* Event context: In event handlers or callback functions triggered by events, this often refers to the element that fired the event. This allows the event handler to interact with the specific element.

* Explicit binding: JavaScript provides methods like call(), apply(), and bind() that allow you to explicitly set the value of this within a function. This allows you to control the context in which a function is executed.

#
3. 
* **Answer**

In JavaScript, the `call(), apply()`, and `bind()` methods are used to explicitly set the value of this within a function and control its execution context. While they have similar purposes, there are some differences in how they are used.
*` call()`: The call() method is used to invoke a function with a specified this value and additional arguments provided individually. It accepts the this context as the first argument, followed by the function arguments separated by commas. The function is immediately invoked with the given context and arguments.
```
function greet(message) {
  console.log(message + ', ' + this.name);
}

const person = { name: 'John' };

greet.call(person, 'Hello');
// Output: Hello, John

```
* `apply()`: The apply() method is similar to call(), but it accepts the this context as the first argument and an array (or an array-like object) as the second argument containing the function arguments. The function is invoked immediately with the given context and arguments provided as an array.
```
function greet(message) {
  console.log(message + ', ' + this.name);
}

const person = { name: 'John' };
const args = ['Hello'];

greet.apply(person, args);
// Output: Hello, John
```
* `bind()`: The bind() method is used to create a new function with a specified this value and, optionally, pre-defined arguments. Unlike call() and apply(), bind() does not immediately execute the function. Instead, it returns a new function with the bound this context and any provided arguments. This allows you to execute the function at a later time or pass it as a callback.
```
function greet(message) {
  console.log(message + ', ' + this.name);
}

const person = { name: 'John' };
const greetPerson = greet.bind(person);

greetPerson('Hello');
// Output: Hello, John

```
* The main difference between call() and apply() lies in how the function arguments are passed. call() expects individual arguments, while apply() takes an array or an array-like object. bind() creates a new function with a bound this context and optional pre-defined arguments, without immediately executing the function.
#
4. Explain OOPS ? 
* **Answer**

OOPS, or Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. It provides a way to structure and design software by encapsulating data and behaviors into reusable and modular units called objects.

The key concepts of OOP include:

* Classes: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes or data) and behaviors (methods or functions) that objects of that class should have. It defines the structure and behavior of objects but does not represent a specific instance itself.

* Objects: Objects are instances of classes. They are created based on the structure defined by a class and have their own unique state and behavior. Objects can interact with each other, communicate, and manipulate their data.

* Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and related methods together within a class, hiding the internal details and providing a public interface to interact with the object. It helps in achieving data abstraction and information hiding, allowing for better code organization, security, and reusability.

* Inheritance: Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes, establishing a hierarchical relationship between them. It enables code reuse and the creation of specialized classes (subclasses) that inherit and extend the functionality of a base class (superclass).

* Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to be defined in the superclass and overridden in the subclasses, enabling different objects to respond differently to the same method call.

These concepts of OOP help in creating modular, scalable, and maintainable code. They promote code reusability, abstraction, and organization by providing a clear separation of concerns and allowing for the creation of complex systems through composition and collaboration of objects.

OOP is widely used in various programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript. It provides a structured and intuitive way of modeling real-world entities and their interactions, making it easier to design, develop, and maintain software systems.

#
5. Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?
* **Answer**
Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on representing essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary or complex details. It involves creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a common set of properties and methods that are relevant to a group of objects.

The purpose of abstraction is to simplify the complexity of a system by providing a clear and concise interface for interacting with objects. Here are some key aspects and purposes of abstraction:

* Simplification: Abstraction allows developers to focus on the essential aspects of an object or system while hiding the underlying complexity. It provides a high-level view that simplifies understanding and usage, enabling programmers to work with objects at a conceptual level rather than dealing with intricate implementation details.

* Encapsulation: Abstraction and encapsulation go hand in hand. Abstraction defines a clear boundary between the external interface (what is accessible to other objects) and the internal implementation details (hidden from other objects). It allows objects to encapsulate their internal state and behavior, providing controlled access and protecting sensitive data.

* Modularity and Reusability: Abstraction promotes modularity by breaking down a system into smaller, self-contained units. These units, represented by abstract classes or interfaces, can be reused in different contexts or projects. By providing a common interface, abstraction allows objects to be easily interchanged and extended, promoting code reusability and reducing duplication.

* Maintenance and Scalability: Abstraction improves the maintainability and scalability of code. By focusing on the essential aspects of an object and decoupling it from implementation details, changes or updates to the underlying implementation can be made without affecting the objects that rely on the abstract interface. This allows for easier maintenance and flexibility in accommodating future changes.

* Collaboration and Teamwork: Abstraction facilitates collaboration among developers working on different components of a system. By defining clear abstract interfaces, multiple developers can work independently on different parts of a system, relying on the agreed-upon abstractions to ensure compatibility and interoperability.

Abstraction provides a powerful mechanism for managing complexity, enhancing code organization, promoting code reuse, and improving maintainability. It enables developers to work at higher levels of abstraction, focusing on the essential aspects of objects and systems, and abstracting away unnecessary details.

#
6. Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?
* **Answer**
Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It refers to the ability of objects to respond differently to the same method call, based on their specific implementation of that method.

The purpose of polymorphism is to enable code flexibility, extensibility, and code reuse. Here are some key aspects and purposes of polymorphism:

* Code Flexibility: Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes, as long as they share a common interface or superclass. This flexibility allows you to design systems that can easily accommodate new classes or variations without modifying the existing code. It promotes loose coupling and reduces dependencies, making the code more adaptable and maintainable.

* Code Extensibility: Polymorphism supports the creation of new classes that inherit from a common superclass and override its methods. These subclasses can provide specialized implementations of the inherited methods while adding their own unique behavior. This enables you to extend the functionality of existing classes without modifying their code, promoting code reuse and modularity.

* Method Overriding: Polymorphism allows subclasses to override methods inherited from a superclass. This means that objects of the subclass can respond differently to the same method call, providing specific behavior based on their class implementation. Method overriding is a key feature of polymorphism that allows for dynamic dispatch, where the appropriate method implementation is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.

* Interface Compatibility: Polymorphism allows you to define interfaces or abstract classes that provide a common set of methods that participating classes must implement. This enables you to write code that can work with objects of different classes as long as they conform to the defined interface. It promotes code interoperability and supports the use of composition and dependency injection, allowing objects to collaborate without being tightly coupled to specific implementations.

* Code Reusability: Polymorphism encourages code reusability by providing a mechanism to treat objects of different classes uniformly. By programming to interfaces or superclasses, you can create generic code that can be used with various implementations. This reduces code duplication, promotes modularity, and simplifies maintenance.

Polymorphism plays a vital role in achieving flexible, extensible, and modular code. It enables you to write code that is more adaptable to changes, promotes code reuse, and supports collaboration between different objects and classes. By leveraging polymorphism, you can create more scalable and maintainable software systems.

#
7. Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?
* **Answer**
In JavaScript, inheritance is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, forming a prototype chain. It provides a way to create a relationship between objects, where one object can inherit the features of another object.

The purpose of inheritance in JavaScript is to promote code reuse, abstraction, and modularity. Here are some key aspects and purposes of inheritance in JavaScript:

* Code Reuse: Inheritance allows you to define common properties and methods in a base object or prototype and share them among multiple derived objects. Derived objects inherit the properties and methods defined in their prototype, reducing code duplication and promoting code reuse. This enables you to create objects with shared functionality while minimizing the amount of code needed.

* Prototype-based Inheritance: JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, where objects are linked to a prototype object. Each object has an internal link to its prototype, and properties and methods not found in the object are automatically looked up in its prototype. This chain of linked prototypes forms the prototype chain, allowing objects to inherit from their prototypes.

* Object Composition: In JavaScript, inheritance is often achieved through object composition, where an object is created by composing or combining multiple other objects. This allows for flexible and dynamic composition of objects, promoting code modularity and allowing for the creation of complex objects by combining simpler ones.

* Code Abstraction: Inheritance enables code abstraction by allowing you to define common behaviors and properties in a base object or prototype. By inheriting from this base object, derived objects can utilize the shared behaviors and properties without having to define them explicitly. This abstraction helps in separating concerns, reducing code complexity, and promoting code organization.

* Polymorphism: Inheritance in JavaScript supports polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes or prototypes to be treated as objects of a common type. By adhering to a common interface or following a shared prototype chain, objects can respond to the same method calls even if they have different internal implementations. This flexibility allows for interchangeable usage of objects and promotes code extensibility.

In JavaScript, inheritance is achieved using prototype-based programming, where objects inherit properties and methods from their prototypes. This enables code reuse, abstraction, modularity, and polymorphism, making JavaScript a versatile language for object-oriented programming.
#
8. Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ?
* **Answer**
In JavaScript, encapsulation is a concept that involves bundling data and related behaviors (methods) together within an object, while controlling the access to that data from outside the object. It allows for the organization and protection of data, providing a clear interface for interacting with the object.

The purpose of encapsulation in JavaScript is to promote data integrity, code modularity, and information hiding. Here are some key aspects and purposes of encapsulation in JavaScript:

* Data Protection and Integrity: Encapsulation helps in protecting the data within an object by defining it as private or inaccessible from outside the object. This prevents accidental or unauthorized modification of the data, ensuring its integrity and maintaining consistency. By controlling the access to data through well-defined methods, encapsulation helps enforce data validation and encapsulates the logic for maintaining data consistency.

* Code Modularity and Organization: Encapsulation facilitates code modularity by grouping related data and behaviors within an object. It allows you to encapsulate the internal implementation details of an object, hiding complexity and providing a clean external interface. This promotes code organization and separates concerns, making code more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

* Information Hiding: Encapsulation supports the principle of information hiding, which means that the internal implementation details of an object are not exposed to external entities. By exposing only a well-defined interface or public methods, encapsulation hides the internal complexity and provides a level of abstraction. This simplifies the usage of an object and decouples it from potential changes in its internal implementation, promoting code stability and reducing dependencies.

* Code Security: Encapsulation enhances code security by restricting direct access to the internal data of an object. By providing controlled access through methods, you can enforce access restrictions, validation rules, or authentication mechanisms. This helps prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of data, ensuring the security and integrity of the object.

* Code Evolution and Maintenance: Encapsulation supports code evolution and maintenance by encapsulating implementation details within an object. This means that changes made to the internal implementation of an object do not affect the external code that relies on the object's public interface. This promotes code extensibility, allows for easier maintenance, and reduces the impact of changes on other parts of the codebase.

Encapsulation in JavaScript, achieved through the use of closures, private variables, and the module pattern, provides a way to organize, protect, and control access to data and behaviors within objects. It promotes code modularity, data integrity, information hiding, and code security, leading to more robust and maintainable JavaScript code.
#
9. Explain Class in JavaScript?
* **Answer**
In JavaScript, the class syntax was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a more convenient and structured way to define objects and their behaviors. Despite the name "class," JavaScript's implementation of classes is based on prototype-based inheritance rather than traditional class-based inheritance found in some other languages.

A class in JavaScript serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates the properties (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class should have. The class defines the structure and behavior of objects but does not represent a specific instance itself.

Here's an example of defining a class in JavaScript:
```
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
}

```

In the example above, Person is the name of the class. It has a constructor method that is automatically called when creating a new instance of the class. The constructor initializes the name and age properties of the object.

The greet() method is defined within the class. It can be called on instances of the class to perform a specific behavior, such as printing a greeting message.

To create an object (instance) from the class, you use the new keyword followed by the class name and any arguments required by the constructor. Here's an example of creating an instance of the Person class:

```
    const person = new Person("John", 30);
```

In this case, person is an instance of the Person class with the name "John" and age 30.

JavaScript classes also support inheritance. You can use the extends keyword to create a subclass that inherits from a superclass. Subclasses can extend the functionality of the superclass, override its methods, and add new methods and properties specific to the subclass.

Classes in JavaScript provide a structured and convenient way to define objects, their properties, and their behaviors. They allow you to create objects based on a blueprint, encapsulate data and methods within the class, and support inheritance for code reuse and extensibility.
#
10. Whatâ€™s Super Keyword & What it does?
* **Answer**
In JavaScript, the super keyword is used to call and access the parent class's constructor, methods, and properties within a subclass. It provides a way to reference the parent class and invoke its functionality while extending or overriding it in the subclass.

The super keyword can be used in two ways:

* Calling the Parent Class's Constructor: When a subclass has its own constructor, the super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class. This is done to ensure that the initialization logic defined in the parent class's constructor is executed before any additional logic in the subclass's constructor.

Example:
```
class Parent {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Child extends Parent {
  constructor(name, age) {
    super(name); // Call the parent class's constructor
    this.age = age;
  }
}

const child = new Child("John", 10);
console.log(child.name); // Output: John
console.log(child.age); // Output: 10

```
* Accessing Parent Class's Methods: The super keyword can also be used to access and call methods from the parent class within the subclass. This is useful when you want to extend the behavior of the parent class's method in the subclass while still using the original implementation.

Example:
```
class Parent {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, I am the parent.");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent {
  greet() {
    super.greet(); // Call the parent class's method
    console.log("And I am the child.");
  }
}

const child = new Child();
child.greet();
// Output:
// Hello, I am the parent.
// And I am the child.

```

The super keyword provides a way to invoke the parent class's functionality within a subclass, enabling code reuse and extension. It helps maintain the inheritance hierarchy and facilitates the customization of behavior in subclasses while leveraging the existing implementation in the parent class.
